abstract = {We describe a technique for constraining macroscopic fluctuations in thermodynamic variables well-suited for Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of multiphase equilibria. In particular for multicomponent systems this amounts to a statistical ensemble that implements constraints on both the average composition as well as its fluctuations. The variance-constrained semi-grand-canonical (VC-SGC) ensemble allows for MC simulations, in which single-phase systems can be reversibly switched into multiphase equilibria allowing the calculation of excess free energies of precipitates of complex shapes by thermodynamic integration. The basic features as well as the scaling and convergence properties of this technique are demonstrated by an application to an Ising model. Finally, the VC-SGC MC simulation technique is used to calculate $\alpha$/$\alpha$ interface free energies in Fe-Cr alloys as a function of orientation and temperature taking into account configurational, vibrational, and structural degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {Machine learning has been effective at detecting patterns and predicting the response of systems that behave free of natural laws. Examples include learning crowd dynamics, recommender systems and autonomous mobility. There also have been applications to the search for new materials that draw upon big-data classification problems. However, when it comes to physical systems governed by conservation laws, the role of machine learning has been more limited. Here, we present our recent work in exploring the role of machine learning methods in discovering, or aiding, the search for physics. Specifically, we focus on using machine learning algorithms to represent high-dimensional free energy surfaces with the goal of identifying precipitate morphologies in alloy systems. Traditionally, this problem has been approached by combining phase field models, which impose first-order dynamics, with elasticity, to traverse a free energy landscape in search of minima. Equilibrium precipitate morphologies occur at these minima. Here, we exploit the machine learning methods to represent high-dimensional data, combined with surrogate optimization, sensitivity analysis and multifidelity modeling as an alternate framework to explore phenomena controlled by energy extremization. This combination of data-driven methods offers an alternative to the imposition of first-order dynamics via phase field methods, and represents one aspect of applying machine learning to materials physics.},

abstract = {Many algorithms for graph layout have been devised over the last 30 years spanning both the graph drawing and information visualisation communities. This article first reviews the advances made in the field of graph drawing that have then often been applied by the information visualisation community. There then follows a discussion of a range of techniques developed specifically for graph visualisations. Graph drawing algorithms are categorised into the following approaches: force-directed layouts, the use of dimension reduction in graph layout and computational improvements including multi-level techniques. Methods developed specifically for graph visualisation often make use of node-attributes and are categorised based on whether the attributes are used to introduce constraints to the layout, provide a clustered view or define an explicit representation in two-dimensional space. The similarities and distinctions between these techniques are examined and the aim is to provide a detailed assessment of currently available graph layout techniques, specifically how they can be used by visualisation practitioners, and to motivate further research in the area.},

With the recent advent of many 3D sensors, there is a growing interest in transposing and solving PDEs on surfaces and point clouds. In this paper, we propose a simple method to solve such PDEs using the framework of PDEs on graphs. This latter approach enables us to transcribe, for surfaces and point clouds, many models and algorithms designed for image processing. To illustrate our proposal, three problems are considered: 1) (p)-Laplacian restoration and inpainting; 2) PDEs mathematical morphology; and 3) active contours segmentation. {\textcopyright} 1992-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Rudraraju2016,
abstract = {We present a phenomenological treatment of diffusion-driven martensitic phase transformations in multi-component crystalline solids that arise from non-convex free energies in mechanical and chemical variables. The treatment describes diffusional phase transformations that are accompanied by symmetry-breaking structural changes of the crystal unit cell and reveals the importance of a mechanochemical spinodal, defined as the region in strain-composition space, where the free-energy density function is non-convex. The approach is relevant to phase transformations wherein the structural order parameters can be expressed as linear combinations of strains relative to a high-symmetry reference crystal. The governing equations describing mechanochemical spinodal decomposition are variationally derived from a free-energy density function that accounts for interfacial energy via gradients of the rapidly varying strain and composition fields. A robust computational framework for treating the coupled, higher-order diffusion and nonlinear strain gradient elasticity problems is presented. Because the local strains in an inhomogeneous, transforming microstructure can be finite, the elasticity problem must account for geometric nonlinearity. An evaluation of available experimental phase diagrams and first-principles free energies suggests that mechanochemical spinodal decomposition should occur in metal hydrides such as ZrH 2 − 2c. The rich physics that ensues is explored in several numerical examples in two and three dimensions, and the relevance of the mechanism is discussed in the context of important electrode materials for Li-ion batteries and high-temperature ceramics.},

@article{Pferschy2017,
abstract = {The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most prominent combinatorial optimization problems. Given a complete graph [Formula: see text] and non-negative distances d for every edge, the TSP asks for a shortest tour through all vertices with respect to the distances d. The method of choice for solving the TSP to optimality is a branch and cut approach. Usually the integrality constraints are relaxed first and all separation processes to identify violated inequalities are done on fractional solutions. In our approach we try to exploit the impressive performance of current ILP-solvers and work only with integer solutions without ever interfering with fractional solutions. We stick to a very simple ILP-model and relax the subtour elimination constraints only. The resulting problem is solved to integer optimality, violated constraints (which are trivial to find) are added and the process is repeated until a feasible solution is found. In order to speed up the algorithm we pursue several attempts to find as many relevant subtours as possible. These attempts are based on the clustering of vertices with additional insights gained from empirical observations and random graph theory. Computational results are performed on test instances taken from the TSPLIB95 and on random Euclidean graphs.},

abstract = {We employed a real-space formulation of orbital-free density functional theory using finite-element basis to study the defect-core and energetics of an edge dislocation in Aluminum. Our study shows that the core-size of a perfect edge dislocation is around ten times the magnitude of the Burgers vector. This finding is contrary to the widely accepted notion that continuum descriptions of dislocation energetics are accurate beyond ∼1-3 Burgers vector from the dislocation line. Consistent with prior electronic-structure studies, we find that the perfect edge dislocation dissociates into two Shockley partials with a partial separation distance of 12.8 {\AA}. Interestingly, our study revealed a significant influence of macroscopic deformations on the core-energy of Shockley partials. We show that this dependence of the core-energy on macroscopic deformations results in an additional force on dislocations, beyond the Peach-Koehler force, that is proportional to strain gradients. Further, we demonstrate that this force from core-effects can be significant and can play an important role in governing the dislocation behavior in regions of inhomogeneous deformations.},

abstract = {We present a contribution to the field of system identification of partial differential equations (PDEs), with emphasis on discerning between competing mathematical models of pattern-forming physics. The motivation comes from developmental biology, where pattern formation is central to the development of any multicellular organism, and from materials physics, where phase transitions similarly lead to microstructure. In both these fields there is a collection of nonlinear, parabolic PDEs that, over suitable parameter intervals and regimes of physics, can resolve the patterns or microstructures with comparable fidelity. This observation frames the question of which PDE best describes the data at hand. This question is particularly compelling because identification of the closest representation to the true PDE, while constrained by the functional spaces considered relative to the data at hand, immediately delivers insights to the physics underlying the systems. While building on recent work that uses stepwise regression, we present advances that leverage the variational framework and statistical tests. We also address the influences of variable fidelity and noise in the data.},

abstract = {There are currently several communities working on algorithms for classification of high dimensional data. This work develops a class of variational algorithms that combine recent ideas from spectral methods on graphs with nonlinear edge/region detection methods traditionally used in the PDE-based imaging community. The algorithms are based on the Ginzburg-Landau functional which has classical PDE connections to total variation minimization. Convex-splitting algorithms allow us to quickly find minimizers of the proposed model and take advantage of fast spectral solvers of linear graph-theoretic problems. We present diverse computational examples involving both basic clustering and semisupervised learning for different applications. Case studies include feature identification in images, segmentation in social networks, and segmentation of shapes in high dimensional datasets. Introduction. The work develops a new algorithm for classification of high dimensional data on graphs. The method bridges gaps between the PDE-image processing community, methods related to L 1 compressive sensing, and the graph-theoretic community. The algorithm is inspired by diffuse interface methods that have long been used in physical science modeling of problems with free boundaries and interfaces. These same ideas also arise in compressive sensing because of the connection between the diffuse interface energies and total variation (TV) minimization. Thus it is natural to extend these concepts beyond classical continuum modeling to the discrete graph framework. By implementing various techniques for fast linear algebra and eigenfunction decomposition, we can design methods that are quite good in terms of performance and speed. They are also versatile, and we illustrate examples on a variety of datasets including congressional voting records, high dimensional test data, and machine learning in image processing. This paper is structured as follows: In section 1 we review diffuse interface methods in Euclidean space and convex splitting methods for minimization. These well-known constructions make heavy use of the classical Laplace operator, and our new algorithms involve extensions of this idea to a more general graph Laplacian. Section 2 reviews some of the notation and definitions of the graph Laplacian, and this discussion contains a level of detail appropriate for readers less familiar with this machinery.},

abstract = {Mollusk shells are an ideal model system for understanding the morpho-elastic basis of morphological evolution of invertebrates' exoskeletons. During the formation of the shell, the mantle tissue secretes proteins and minerals that calcify to form a new incremental layer of the exoskeleton. Most of the existing literature on the morphology of mollusks is descriptive. The mathematical understanding of the underlying coupling between pre-existing shell morphology, de novo surface deposition and morpho-elastic volume growth is at a nascent stage, primarily limited to reduced geometric representations. Here, we propose a general, three-dimensional computational framework coupling pre-existing morphology, incremental surface growth by accretion, and morpho-elastic volume growth. We exercise this framework by applying it to explain the stepwise morphogenesis of seashells during growth: new material surfaces are laid down by accretive growth on the mantle whose form is determined by its morpho-elastic growth. Calcification of the newest surfaces extends the shell as well as creates a new scaffold that constrains the next growth step. We study the effects of surface and volumetric growth rates, and of previously deposited shell geometries on the resulting modes of mantle deformation, and therefore of the developing shell's morphology. Connections are made to a range of complex shells ornamentations.},

@techreport{Sagiyama2018,
abstract = {We present an approach to numerical homogenization of the elastic response of microstructures. Our work uses deep neural network representations trained on data obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS) of martensitic phase transformations. The microscopic model leading to the microstructures is based on non-convex free energy density functions that give rise to martensitic variants, and must be extended to gradient theories of elasticity at finite strain. These strain gradients introduce interfacial energies as well as coercify the model, enabling the admission of a large number of solutions, each having finely laminated microstructures. The numerical stiffness of these DNS solutions and the fine scales of response make the data expensive to obtain, while also motivating the search for homogenized representations of their response for the purpose of engineering design. The high-dimensionality of the problem is reduced by training deep neural networks (DNNs) on the effective response by using the scalar free energy density data. The novelty in our approach is that the trained DNNs also return high-fidelity representations of derivative data, specifically the stresses. This allows the recapitulation of the classic hyperelastic response of continuum elasticity via the DNN representation. Also included are detailed optimization studies over hyperparameters, and convergence with size of datasets.},

abstract = {The graph Laplacian and the graph cut problem are closely related to Markov random fields, and have many applications in clustering and image segmentation. The diffuse interface model is widely used for modeling in material science, and can also be used as a proxy to total variation minimization. In Bertozzi and Flenner (Multiscale Model Simul 10(3):1090-1118, 2012), an algorithm was developed to generalize the diffuse interface model to graphs to solve the graph cut problem. This work analyzes the conditions for the graph diffuse interface algorithm to converge. Using techniques from numerical PDE and convex optimization, monotonicity in function value and convergence under an a posteriori condition are shown for a class of schemes under a graph-independent stepsize condition. We also generalize our results to incorporate spectral truncation, a common technique used to save computation cost, and also to the case of multiclass classification. Various numerical experiments are done to compare theoretical results with practical performance.},

abstract = {We report on a comprehensive first-principles study of phase stability in the Ni-Al binary, both at zero Kelvin and at finite temperature. First-principles density functional theory calculations of the energies of enumerated orderings on fcc and the sublattices of B2 not only predict the stability of known phases, but also reveal the stability of a family of ordered phases that combine features of L1 2 and L1 0 in different ratios to adjust their overall composition. The calculations also confirm the stability of vacancy ordered B2 derivatives that are stable in the Al-rich half of the phase diagram. We introduce strain order parameters to systematically analyze instabilities with respect to the Bain path connecting the fcc and bcc lattices. Many unstable orderings on both fcc and bcc are predicted around compositions of x Ni = 0.625, where a martensitic phase transformation is known to occur. Cluster expansion techniques together with Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate a finite-temperature-composition phase diagram of the Ni-Al binary. The calculated phase diagram together with an analysis of Bain instabilities reveals the importance of anharmonicity in determining the phase bounds between the B2 based $\beta$ phase and the L1 2 based $\gamma$ phase, as well as properties related to martensitic transformations that are observed upon quenching Ni-rich $\beta$.},

abstract = {A graph theoretic perspective is taken for a range of phenomena in continuum physics in order to develop representations for analysis of large scale, high-fidelity solutions to these problems. Of interest are phenomena described by partial differential equations, with solutions being obtained by computation. The motivation is to gain insight that may otherwise be difficult to attain because of the high dimensionality of computed solutions. We consider graph theoretic representations that are made possible by low-dimensional states defined on the systems. These states are typically functionals of the high-dimensional solutions, and therefore retain important aspects of the high-fidelity information present in the original, computed solutions. Our approach is rooted in regarding each state as a vertex on a graph and identifying edges via processes that are induced either by numerical solution strategies, or by the physics. Correspondences are drawn between the sampling of stationary states, or the time evolution of dynamic phenomena, and the analytic machinery of graph theory. A collection of computations is examined in this framework and new insights to them are presented through analysis of the corresponding graphs.},

abstract = {Constraint integer programming (CIP) is a novel paradigm which integrates constraint programming (CP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and satisfi-ability (SAT) modeling and solving techniques. In this paper we discuss the software framework and solver SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs), which is free for academic and non-commercial use and can be downloaded in source code. This paper gives an overview of the main design concepts of SCIP and how it can be used to solve constraint integer programs. To illustrate the performance and flexibility of SCIP, we apply it to two different problem classes. First, we consider mixed integer programming and show by computational experiments that SCIP is almost competitive to specialized commercial MIP solvers, even though SCIP supports the more general constraint integer programming paradigm. We develop new ingredients that improve current MIP solving technology. As a second application, we employ SCIP to solve chip design verification problems as they arise in the logic design of integrated circuits. This application goes far beyond traditional MIP solving, as it includes several highly non-linear constraints, which can be handled nicely within the constraint integer programming framework. We show anecdotally how the different solving techniques from MIP, CP, and SAT work together inside SCIP to deal with such constraint classes. Finally, experimental results show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques for proving the validity of properties on circuits containing arithmetic.},

@book{Rossi2006,
abstract = {1st ed. Constraint programming is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial search problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, computer science, databases, programming languages, and operations research. Constraint programming is currently applied with success to many domains, such as scheduling, planning, vehicle routing, configuration, networks, and bioinformatics. The aim of this handbook is to capture the full breadth and depth of the constraint programming field and to be encyclopedic in its scope and coverage. While there are several excellent books on constraint programming, such books necessarily focus on the main notions and techniques and cannot cover also extensions, applications, and languages. The handbook gives a reasonably complete coverage of all these lines of work, based on constraint programming, so that a reader can have a rather precise idea of the whole field and its potential. Of course each line of work is dealt with in a survey-like style, where some details may be neglected in favor of coverage. However, the extensive bibliography of each chapter will help the interested readers to find suitable sources for the missing details. Each chapter of the handbook is intended to be a self-contained survey of a topic, and is written by one or more authors who are leading researchers in the area. The intended audience of the handbook is researchers, graduate students, higher-year undergraduates and practitioners who wish to learn about the state-of-the-art in constraint programming. No prior knowledge about the field is necessary to be able to read the chapters and gather useful knowledge. Researchers from other fields should find in this handbook an effective way to learn about constraint programming and to possibly use some of the constraint programming concepts and techniques in their work, thus providing a means for a fruitful cross-fertilization among different research areas. The handbook is organized in two parts. The first part covers the basic foundations of constraint programming, including the history, the notion of constraint propagation, basic search methods, global constraints, tractability and computational complexity, and important issues in modeling a problem as a constraint problem. The second part covers constraint languages and solver, several useful extensions to the basic framework (such as interval constraints, structured domains, and distributed CSPs), and successful application areas for constraint programming. - Covers the whole field of constraint programming - Survey-style chapters - Five chapters on applications.

abstract = {Pattern formation is a widely observed phenomenon in diverse fields including materials physics, developmental biology and ecology, among many others. The physics underlying the patterns is specific to the mechanisms, and is encoded by partial differential equations (PDEs). With the aim of discovering hidden physics, we have previously presented a variational approach to identifying such systems of PDEs in the face of noisy data at varying fidelities (Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 353:201-216, 2019). Here, we extend our vari-ational system identification methods to address the challenges presented by image data on microstructures in materials physics. PDEs are formally posed as initial and boundary value problems over combinations of time intervals and spatial domains whose evolution is either fixed or can be tracked. However, the vast majority of microscopy techniques for evolving microstruc-ture in a given material system deliver micrographs of pattern evolution over domains that bear no relation with each other at different time instants. The temporal resolution can rarely capture the fastest time scales that dominate the early dynamics, and noise abounds. Furthermore, data for evolution of the same phenomenon in a material system may well be obtained from different physical specimens. Against this backdrop of spatially unrelated, sparse and multi-source data, we exploit the variational framework to make judicious choices of weighting functions and identify PDE operators from the dynamics. A consistency condition arises for parsimonious inference of a minimal set of the spatial operators at steady state. It is complemented by a confirmation test that provides a sharp condition for acceptance of the inferred operators. The entire framework is demonstrated on synthetic data that reflect the characteristics of the experimental material microscopy images.},

We have chosen for our work, Toupin's theory (Toupin, 1962)–one of the more general formulations of strain gradient elasticity. Our framework has three crucial ingredients: The first is isogeometric analysis (Hughes et al., 2005), which we have adopted for its straightforward and robust representation of C1-continuity. The second is a weak treatment of the higher-order Dirichlet boundary conditions in the formulation, which control the development of strain gradients in the solution. The third ingredient is algorithmic (automatic) differentiation, which eliminates the need for linearization “by hand” of the rather complicated geometric and material nonlinearities in gradient elasticity at finite strains. We present a number of numerical solutions to demonstrate that the framework is applicable to arbitrary boundary value problems in three dimensions. We discuss length scale effects, the role of higher-order boundary conditions, and perhaps most importantly, the relevance of the framework to problems with elastic free energy density functions that are non-convex in strain space.},

abstract = {The quest for accurate exchange-correlation functionals has long remained a grand challenge in density functional theory (DFT), as it describes the many-electron quantum mechanical behavior through a computationally tractable quantity—the electron density—without resorting to multi-electron wave functions. The inverse DFT problem of mapping the ground-state density to its exchange-correlation potential is instrumental in aiding functional development in DFT. However, the lack of an accurate and systematically convergent approach has left the problem unresolved, heretofore. This work presents a numerically robust and accurate scheme to evaluate the exact exchange-correlation potentials from correlated ab-initio densities. We cast the inverse DFT problem as a constrained optimization problem and employ a finite-element basis—a systematically convergent and complete basis—to discretize the problem. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of our approach for both weakly and strongly correlated molecular systems, including up to 58 electrons, showing relevance to realistic polyatomic molecules.},

abstract = {The problem of obtaining the best integer solution to a linear program comes up in several contexts. The connection with combina-torial problems is given by Dantzig in [l], the connection with problems involving economies of scale is given by Markowitz and Manne [3 ] in a paper which also contains an interesting example of the effect of discrete variables on a scheduling problem. Also Dreyfus [4] has discussed the role played by the requirement of discreteness of variables in limiting the range of problems amenable to linear programming techniques. It is the purpose of this note to outline a finite algorithm for obtaining integer solutions to linear programs. The algorithm has been programmed successfully on an E101 computer and used to run off the integer solution to small (seven or less variables) linear programs completely automatically. The algorithm closely resembles the procedures already used by Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson [2], and Markowitz and Manne [3] to obtain solutions to discrete variable programming problems. Their procedure is essentially this. Given the linear program, first maximize the objective function using the simplex method, then examine the solution. If the solution is not in integers, ingenuity is used to formulate a new constraint that can be shown to be satisfied by the still unknown integer solution but not by the noninteger solution already attained. This additional constraint is added to the original ones, the solution already attained becomes nonfeasible, and a new maximum satisfying the new constraint is sought. This process is repeated until an integer maximum is obtained, or until some argument shows that a nearby integer point is optimal. What has been needed to transform this procedure into an algorithm is a systematic method for generating},

abstract = {A microscopic diffusional theory for the motion of a curved antiphase boundary is presented. The interfacial velocity is found to be linearly proportional to the mean curvature of the boundary, but unlike earlier theories the constant of proportionality does not include the specific surface free energy, yet the diffusional dissipation of free energy is shown to be equal to the reduction in total boundary free energy. The theory is incorporated into a model for antiphase domain coarsening. Experimental measurements of domain coarsening kinetics in Fe-Al alloys were made over a temperature range where the specific surface free energy was varied by more than two orders of magnitude. The results are consistent with the theory; in particular, the domain coarsening kinetics do not have the temperature dependence of the specific surface free energy.

An efficient iterative method for approximating this bound closely from below is presented. A branch-and-bound procedure based upon these considerations has easily produced proven optimum solutions to all traveling-salesman problems presented to it, ranging in size up to sixty-four cities. The bounds used are so sharp that the search trees are minuscule compared to those normally encountered in combinatorial problems of this type. 0. Introduction In a previous paper [7], the authors explored the relationship between the symmetric traveling-salesman problem and the minimum spanning tree problem. By means of this relationship a lower bound on the cost of an optimum tour was derived which is quite sharp, and hence of value in connection with branch-and-bound procedures. The methods proposed in [7] for computing this bound proved inadequate. The present paper gives an efficient method for approximating the bound closely from below, and reports on the use of this method in a highly successful algorithm for the exact solution of symmetric traveling-salesman problems.},

abstract = {We introduce a nonlocal discrete regularization framework on weighted graphs of the arbitrary topologies for image and manifold processing. The approach considers the problem as a variational one, which consists of minimizing a weighted sum of two energy terms: a regularization one that uses a discrete weighted p-Dirichlet energy and an approximation one. This is the discrete analogue of recent continuous Euclidean nonlocal regularization functionals. The proposed formulation leads to a family of simple and fast nonlinear processing methods based on the weighted p-Laplace operator, parameterized by the degree p of regularity, the graph structure and the graph weight function. These discrete processing methods provide a graph-based version of recently proposed semi-local or nonlocal processing methods used in image and mesh processing, such as the bilateral filter, the TV digital filter or the nonlocal means filter. It works with equal ease on regular 2-D and 3-D images, manifolds or any data. We illustrate the abilities of the approach by applying it to various types of images, meshes, manifolds, and data represented as graphs. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

Assuming a familiarity with the basics of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, the book establishes a general framework for describing condensed phases of matter, based on symmetries and conservation laws. It explores the role of spatial dimensionality and microscopic interactions in determining the nature of phase transitions, as well as discussing the structure and properties of materials with different symmetries. Particular attention is given to critical phenomena and renormalization group methods. The properties of liquids, liquid crystals, quasicrystals, crystalline solids, magnetically ordered systems and amorphous solids are investigated in terms of their symmetry, generalised rigidity, hydrodynamics and topological defect structure. In addition to serving as a course text, this book is an essential reference for students and researchers in physics, applied physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering, who are interested in modern condensed matter physics.

abstract = {We present two approaches to system identification, i.e. the identification of partial differential equations (PDEs) from measurement data. The first is a regression-based Variational System Identification procedure that is advantageous in not requiring repeated forward model solves and has good scalability to large number of differential operators. However it has strict data type requirements needing the ability to directly represent the operators through the available data. The second is a Bayesian inference framework highly valuable for providing uncertainty quantification, and flexible for accommodating sparse and noisy data that may also be indirect quantities of interest. However, it also requires repeated forward solutions of the PDE models which is expensive and hinders scalability. We provide illustrations of results on a model problem for pattern formation dynamics, and discuss merits of the presented methods. Pattern formation is a widely observed phenomenon in diverse fields including materials physics, developmental biology and ecology among many others. The physics underlying the patterns is specific to the mechanisms, and is encoded by partial differential equations (PDEs). Models of phase separation [1, 2] are widely employed in materials physics. Following Alan Turing's semi-nal work on reaction-diffusion systems [3], a robust literature has developed on the application of nonlinear versions of this class of PDEs to model pattern for-*},

abstract = {We present several new steepest-edge simplex algorithms for solving linear programming problems, including variants of both the primal and the dual simplex method. These algorithms differ depending upon the space in which the problem is viewed as residing, and include variants in which this space varies dynamically. We present computational results comparing steepest-edge simplex algorithms and approximate versions of them against simplex algorithms that use standard pivoting rules on truly large-scale real-world linear programs with as many as tens of thousands of rows and columns. These results demonstrate unambiguously the superiority of steepest-edge pivot selection criteria to other pivot selection criteria in the simplex method.},

@book{Applegate2006,
abstract = {This book presents the latest findings on one of the most intensely investigated subjects in computational mathematics--the traveling salesman problem. It sounds simple enough: given a set of cities and the cost of travel between each pair of them, the problem challenges you to find the cheapest route by which to visit all the cities and return home to where you began. Though seemingly modest, this exercise has inspired studies by mathematicians, chemists, and physicists. Teachers use it in the classroom. It has practical applications in genetics, telecommunications, and neuroscience. The authors of this book are the same pioneers who for nearly two decades have led the investigation into the traveling salesman problem. They have derived solutions to almost eighty-six thousand cities, yet a general solution to the problem has yet to be discovered. Here they describe the method and computer code they used to solve a broad range of large-scale problems, and along the way they demonstrate the interplay of applied mathematics with increasingly powerful computing platforms. They also give the fascinating history of the problem--how it developed, and why it continues to intrigue us.},

abstract = {The goal of the TRAVELLING-SALESMAN-PROBLEM is to find a tour that connects all the vertices in a graph at a minimal cost. There are several variants, depending on whether repeated visits are allowed, and depending on whether the distances satisfy a metric. We discuss the relationship between these variants, and give a simple 2-approximation algorithm. We then develop a more involved 1.5-approximation algorithm that relates the TSP to Eulerian tours. 1 The TRAVELLING-SALESMAN-PROBLEM Today we consider the TRAVELLING-SALESMAN-PROBLEM 1 , often abbreviated TSP. The "TSP" 2 is perhaps one of the most famous 3 (and most studied) Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). 1.1 Problem Definition Given a set of cities (i.e., points, or vertices), the goal of the TSP is to find a minimum cost circuit (or cycle, or tour) that visits all the points. More formally, the problem is stated as follows: Definition 1 Given a set V of n points and a distance function d : V × V → R, find a cycle C of minimum cost that contains all the points in V. The cost of a cycle C = (e 1 , e 2 ,. .. , e n) is defined to be e∈C d(e), and we assume that the distance function is non-negative (i.e., d(x, y) ≥ 0). Notice that, unlike the STEINER-TREE problem, there are no Steiner vertices: You have to visit every city. The cities/points may be in some geometric space (e.g., the Euclidean plane), or they may not. If the points are in the Euclidean plane, then it is natural to define d to be the Euclidean distance. Otherwise, d can be arbitrary, i.e. non-metric. See Figure 1 for an example of one instance of the TSP. 1.2 Variants As with the STEINER-TREE problem, there are several variants: • Metric vs. General: In the metric version of the TSP, the distance function d is a metric, i.e., it satisfies the triangle inequality 4. In the general version, d can assign any arbitrary weight to an edge. • Repeated-Visits vs. No-Repeats: The goal of the TSP is to find a cycle that visits every vertex. Can the cycle contain repeated vertices (or does it have to be a simple cycle)? In the version with No-Repeats, the TSP cycle must visit each vertex exactly once. In the version with repeats, it is acceptable to visit each vertex more than once (if that results in a shorter route). 1 The word 'travelling' (2 'l's) is in British and the word 'traveling' (1 'l') is in American. 2 As the abbreviation "TSP" already includes the word 'Problem', we do not say "TSP problem" anymore. 3 We even have a movie for this, see http://www.travellingsalesmanmovie.com/. 4 In the previous lecture about Steiner Tree, we have highlighted that metric version is somewhat easier than the general version.},
